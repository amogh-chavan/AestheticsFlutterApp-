Hello Developer

I have developed a wallpaper app in flutter(Dart). This app uses pexels API for wallpapers images (https://www.pexels.com/). You can register for your own pexels API.

Data.dart file has all the api link which provide data to the app we just need to display the data received from the links into different frames.

Thank you!
